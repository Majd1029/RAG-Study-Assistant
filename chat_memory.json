[{"question": "Explain LoRa with the document attached", "answer": " LoRA (Layer-wise Relevance Attention) is a technique used in Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), as mentioned on page 119 of the PDF file 'temp_Chapitre 3.pdf'. It introduces a specific modification to the attention mechanisms, keeping the attention matrices fixed and applying the lower rank decomposition only to other parts of the model. This allows for greater stability in models where attention mechanisms are critical for performance (PDF: temp_Chapitre 3.pdf, Page 119). Only the matrix B is trainable in LoRA.\n\nFor more details about Delta-LoRA, another extension of LoRA, you can refer to pages 120 and 121 of the same PDF file. Delta-LoRA applies selective updates (delta updates) focusing on layers where learning is most significant, optimizing memory usage (PDF: temp_Chapitre 3.pdf, Page 120). It introduces an update based on the variation between the products of low rank matrices at each training step and applies the incremental difference between A and B at each training step instead of a static addition.\n\nRegarding the objective of the model, it aims to discover themes that traverse documents, even if these themes are not explicitly labeled (PDF: temp_Chapitre 3.pdf, Page 34). An example application for this is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)."}, {"question": "What is the experiences of this profile", "answer": " The profile has experience in the following areas, as detailed in 'temp_Profile.pdf':\n\n1. Backend Mobile Developer: September 2024 - January 2025 (5 months) in Sousse, Tunisia. Key responsibilities included designing custom APIs for mobile app integration with Google Sheets, developing high-performance backends, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to enhance project success rates by 10% (PDF: temp_Profile.pdf, Page 2).\n\n2. Data Analyst: August 2024 - January 2025 (6 months) in Tunisia. The individual optimized data-driven decision-making for international exchange programs by analyzing various data sets such as approvals, projects, and completions (PDF: temp_Profile.pdf, Page 2).\n\n3. Recruitment Specialist: January 2025 - February 2025 (2 months) in Sousse, Tunisia. During this period, the individual executed AIESEC's February 2025 recruitment cycle, managing applicants, facilitating interviews, and supporting coordination of recruitment activities to enhance candidate experience and process flow (PDF: temp_Profile.pdf, Page 2).\n\nThe profile also mentions a strong focus on data-driven recruitment processes and continuous growth, as well as sales and communication skills gained through involvement with AIESEC (PDF: temp_Profile.pdf, Pages 0 and 2)."}]
